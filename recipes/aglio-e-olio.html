    <p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is an Italian pasta recipe that originated in the south of Italy, most probably around the Naples area, and that is now famous all over the world for its simplicity and taste. </p>

    <p>The recipe is a "low-budget" version of another southern-Italian recipe, spaghetti with mussels, where the sauce is made with the same basic ingredients: plenty of extra virgin olive oil, fresh garlic, chili peppers or red pepper flakes, and a sprinkle of finely chopped parsley on top. </p>

    <p>Most often Italians make garlic and oil pasta with spaghetti (hence the original name spaghetti aglio e olio), but you can make variations of this dish with vermicelli, linguine, bucatini, and even angel hair pasta. </p>
