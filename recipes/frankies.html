        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>Frankies are India‚Äôs flavorful street food, also known as the Mumbai Burrito, Bombay Burrito, or roti wrap ‚Äì this
            vegan version is filled with curry mashed potatoes, roasted Indian cauliflower and chickpeas, fresh spinach,
            Cilantro Mint Chutney and Pickled onions, all wrapped up in a warm tortilla. </p>

        <p>Healthy and seriously bursting with flavor! Traditionally these would be wrapped in freshly made roti with a very
            thin layer of egg, but we‚Äôve simplified things here a bit. üòâ</p>

        <p>In our catering business, we would often serve Frankies as mini tacos. Flavorful little Indian Tacos, always a
            huge hit! If going grain-free or gluten-free, you could easily turn the whole thing into a ‚Äúbowl‚Äù, with the
            curry mashed potatoes (or basmati rice) as the flavorful base.</p>

        <p>If you have meat-eaters in your household, feel free to add chicken, which you could roast right alongside the
            cauliflower.</p>

            <li>1‚Äì2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coriander</li>
            <li>tablespoon cumin</li>
            <li>generous pinch chili flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon whole fennel seed ( optional, or use cumin seed or
                coriander seed)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon whole coriander seed (optional)</li>
            <li>4 x extra-large, whole wheat tortillas</li>
            <li>2 handfuls baby spinach</li>
            <li>Few tablespoons Cilantro Mint Chutney (imperative!!!)</li>
            <li>Few tablespoons Quick Pickled Onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425F</li>
            <li><strong>START POTATOES</strong>: Cut potatoes and place them in a medium pot, covered with water and simmer
                until very tender, about 15-20 minutes. <em>At the same time</em>‚Ä¶</li>
            <li><strong>ROAST VEGGIES</strong>: Cut the cauliflower into small florets and place them on a parchment-lined
                sheet pan ( to one side). Add the drained chickpeas to the other side. Drizzle both with <em>olive oil</em>.
                Sprinkle cauliflower and chickpeas with the spices and <em>salt</em>, tossing to coat well. Place in the
                oven and roast for 20-25 minutes tossing halfway through) or until cauliflower is tender.</li>
            <li><strong>SAUCE</strong>: Make the flavorful <a
                    href="https://www.feastingathome.com/cilantro-mint-chutney-recipe/">Cilantro Mint Chutney</a> and quick
                pickled red onions and place both in jars (of course, you could make these both ahead). They take about 5-10
                minutes each. <em>Please don‚Äôt leave out the mint chutney- it‚Äôs imperative!!!</em></li>
            <li><strong>CURRIED POTATOES</strong>: Once the potatoes are very tender, drain but <strong>save about 1 cup of
                    the hot water</strong>. Place the potatoes back in the pot and mash with some of the hot water ( start
                with ¬º-¬Ω cup ) salt, spices and oil and mash the potatoes to combine until smooth. You want a fairly loose,
                spreadable mash so add more hot water if necessary. Scrape down the sides. Stir well. Taste. You want this
                to taste flavorful and slightly salty as the tortilla will mute some of the salt and flavor. Feel free to
                add more ghee or oil as you please for extra richness. Cover and keep warm.</li>
            <li>When the roasted veggies are done, <strong>ASSEMBLE</strong>: Warm the tortillas either in the oven, over a
                gas flame or over a grill, until soft and pliable. Spread generously with the curried potatoes, then top
                with chickpeas, cauliflower <em>making sure to get some of the whole spices that will have dropped to the
                    bottom of the pan</em>. Add a handful of spinach leaves, a few teaspoons of cilantro mint chutney and
                some pickled onions and roll up like a burrito. Keep warm in the oven until ready to serve, or serve
                immediately! You can also refrigerate and reheat for meals on the go.</li>
