    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Frankies are India‚Äôs flavorful street food, also known as the Mumbai Burrito, Bombay Burrito,  or roti wrap ‚Äì this vegan version is filled with curry mashed potatoes, roasted Indian cauliflower and chickpeas, fresh spinach, Cilantro Mint Chutney and Pickled onions, all wrapped up in a warm tortilla. </p>

    <p>Healthy and seriously bursting with flavor! Traditionally these would be wrapped in freshly made roti with a very thin layer of egg, but we‚Äôve simplified things here a bit. üòâ</p>
        
    <p>In our catering business, we would often serve Frankies as mini tacos. Flavorful little Indian Tacos, always a huge hit!  If going grain-free or gluten-free, you could easily turn the whole thing into a ‚Äúbowl‚Äù, with the curry mashed potatoes (or basmati rice) as the flavorful base.</p>
        
   <p>If you have meat-eaters in your household, feel free to add chicken, which you could roast right alongside the cauliflower.</p>
