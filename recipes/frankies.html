    <p>Frankies are India’s flavorful street food, also known as the Mumbai Burrito, Bombay Burrito,  or roti wrap – this vegan version is filled with curry mashed potatoes, roasted Indian cauliflower and chickpeas, fresh spinach, Cilantro Mint Chutney and Pickled onions, all wrapped up in a warm tortilla. </p>

    <p>Healthy and seriously bursting with flavor! Traditionally these would be wrapped in freshly made roti with a very thin layer of egg, but we’ve simplified things here a bit. 😉</p>
        
    <p>In our catering business, we would often serve Frankies as mini tacos. Flavorful little Indian Tacos, always a huge hit!  If going grain-free or gluten-free, you could easily turn the whole thing into a “bowl”, with the curry mashed potatoes (or basmati rice) as the flavorful base.</p>
        
   <p>If you have meat-eaters in your household, feel free to add chicken, which you could roast right alongside the cauliflower.</p>
